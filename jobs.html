    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <p>Systems Coordinator<br/>
        Oadby Plastics Ltd<br/>
        November 2013 - Present</p>

        </ul>
        I was offered the opportunity to advance further within the company by becoming Internal Sales for Stormwater Management. I deal with a wide range of customers on a daily basis via the phone or by email and have built up professional relationships. These customers now deal with us continually every month and have great trust in the technical assistance I can provide. The department requires a lot of proactive work by looking for leads to generate new business and I have been lucky to have colleagues around me which have a wealth of knowledge so have provided me with the skills and confidence I need to project manage and prioritise my workload. It is also my responsibility to make sure that my Sales Support and I are on target with both our calls and the sales target, of which I provide detailed KPI’s to line managers on a monthly basis.</p>

    <p>I started Geosynthetics as an apprentice where I passed my NVQ Level 2 in Business Administration and worked as an Administration Assistant/Sales Support for departments within both Geosynthetics and its sister company Stormwater Management which are both leading suppliers within the construction and civil engineering industry. During this role it was my responsibility to take all incoming calls, produce accurate quotations on the tailor-made CRM system and ensure all information entered was kept up-to-date and cleansed. I also processed all sales orders and liaised with our customers to arrange delivery of the goods and provide the necessary customer service. I pride myself on being efficient and hardworking, not just because of the importance it has for the company but also for our customer’s satisfaction.</p>
